# TrigoAI
A series of AI experiments about trigonometric functions
This project has borned with the purpose of better understading how neural networks work by starting with an easy concept.
The first code is about the Sine function, the base dataset is a sample pool of 10000 values between 0 and 2Ï€. 

What I've tried so far to upgrade the NN:
- Use as activation function ReLU and Leaky ReLU, but noticed a great decrease in performance
- Implemented a backdrop logic but a great decrease in performance (further studies are necessary)
